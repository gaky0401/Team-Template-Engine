# Team-Template-Engine

## Description

Using node and inquirer, I wrote an app that generates team members and populates the information you input into an HTML page. Team members are defined by Manager, Engineer, or intern. Each one has a unique question, so if else statements were used to program this. I also had to run a variety of tests to pass and make sure it was working properly.
